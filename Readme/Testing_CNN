Overview
  This script is designed to evaluate the Farmland Classifier model on a single image to determine if it represents farmland or not. The model, previously trained on a dataset of labeled images, will classify an input image and provide a confidence score for its prediction.

Prerequisites
  Python 3.x
  TensorFlow 2.x
  NumPy
  Python Imaging Library (Pillow)

Installation
  Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed:
  pip install tensorflow numpy Pillow

Configuration
  Model Path: Path to the pre-trained Farmland Classifier model.
  Example: farmland_classifier_model.keras
  Image Path: Path to the image you want to classify.
  Example: /Users/nishanttiwari/Desktop/output_256_1024_328-1343_quad.tif

Features
  Model Loading: Automatically loads the pre-trained Farmland Classifier model.
  Image Preprocessing: Adjusts the input image to the required dimensions and format for the model.
  Prediction and Classification: Utilizes the model to predict the category of the image and outputs both the classification label and confidence.

Usage
  Set Image Path: Update the script with the path to the image you want to classify.
  Execute the Script: Run the script to process the image and output the classification results.
  View Output: The script will display the predicted label and the confidence of the prediction.

Output
The script outputs:

  Classification Label: Indicates whether the image is classified as 'Positive' (farmland) or 'Negative' (non-farmland).
  Confidence Score: Provides the confidence level of the prediction, expressed as a decimal.

Running the Script
  Run the script from your Python environment using the following command:
  python test_single_image.py

Conclusion
  This utility allows for quick testing of individual images using the Farmland Classifier, making it suitable for evaluating model performance or integrating into larger workflows for image classification.
